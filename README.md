# Hotel Reservation System using Client Server API

**Introduction:**\
The Hotel Reservation System project aimed to create a client-server architecture allowing users to inquire about hotel availability based on the current date. The system facilitates seamless communication between clients and a central server to retrieve real-time information regarding hotel bookings. This report outlines the achievements, challenges encountered, and potential future enhancements.

**Achievements:**\
The project has successfully achieved the following milestones:\
**•	Client-Server Communication:** Implemented a robust client-server communication model using socket programming in Python.\
**•	User Interaction:** Enabled users to input their queries regarding hotel availability for a specific date.\
**•	Data Management:** Utilized text files for storing hotel and reservation information.\
**•	Concurrency:** Implemented multithreading to handle multiple client requests concurrently.\
**•	Basic Functionality:** Provided basic functionalities such as querying for hotel availability and receiving responses from the server.

**Design and Code Overview:**\
The project consists of two main components: *the client-side and the server-side*.\
**Client Code:** The client code establishes a connection with the server and prompts the user to input the desired date for hotel availability inquiry. It then sends this information to the server and displays the response received.\
**Server Code:** The server code listens for incoming client connections, handles client requests concurrently using threads, and processes the user queries regarding hotel availability based on the provided date.

**Existing Issues:**\
**•	Concurrency:** The current implementation of the server does not handle multiple client connections concurrently. This limitation can lead to potential bottlenecks when multiple users try to access the system simultaneously.\
**•	Data Storage:** Storing reservation data in a text file may not be scalable for large volumes of transactions. Adopting a more robust database solution could address this issue.

**Future Work:**\
**•	Concurrency Management:** Implementing multi-threading or asynchronous handling in the server can enhance concurrency and allow multiple clients to interact with the system simultaneously.\
**•	Database Integration:** Transitioning from text file storage to a relational database management system (RDBMS) can improve data management and scalability.\
**•	User Interface Enhancement:** Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client-side application can improve usability and provide a more intuitive experience for users.\
**•	Security Measures:** Implement security features such as encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of client-server communication.\
**•	Additional Features:** Introduce advanced features such as online booking, user authentication, and reservation management.
 
**Scoring Criteria:**\
a. **Confidence and Knowledgeable about the project:** The team demonstrates a strong understanding of the project goals and technologies employed.\
b. **Integration Testing:** The system has been thoroughly tested for integration between the client and server components.\
c. **Functional Testing:** Functional testing has been conducted to ensure that the system performs as expected in response to user inputs.\
d. **Completion:** The project meets the basic requirements outlined, providing a functional hotel reservation system.\
e. **Complexity:** The system exhibits moderate complexity, incorporating socket programming and data handling functionalities.\
f. **Creativity:** The project demonstrates creativity in utilizing Python socket programming to implement a client-server architecture for hotel reservations.\
g. **Portfolio Completion:** The project enhances the team's portfolio by showcasing proficiency in networking and software development skills.

**Conclusion:**\
Overall, the Hotel Reservation System project represents a significant achievement in implementing a functional client-server application for hotel bookings. By addressing existing issues and considering potential enhancements outlined in this report, the system can evolve into a comprehensive solution catering to the needs of both hotel administrators and guests. With further refinement and enhancements, it has the potential to become a valuable tool for managing hotel reservations efficiently.
